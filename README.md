# Asaburu

A collection of tools built with Go and WebAssembly, running entirely in the browser with no backend services or external APIs.

## Usage

**Make sure to install [Go](https://go.dev/) first.**

To run locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/doukeshi/asaburu.git
cd asaburu
make serve
```

This starts a local development server and serves the WebAssembly-powered tools.
